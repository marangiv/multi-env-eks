# Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Deployment on AWS

This project deploys and manages a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment on AWS using Terraform and Helm. It includes the setup of EKS clusters in multiple regions, IAM roles and policies, Argo CD for continuous deployment, and additional components like service discovery and monitoring dashboards.

## Project Structure

1. **01-clusters**: Creation and configuration of EKS clusters.
2. **02-autoscaler**: Configuration of the autoscaler for the EKS clusters.
3. **03-iam**: Configuration of the necessary IAM policies.
4. **04-argocd**: Implementation of ArgoCD for managing application deployments on Kubernetes.
 
### Execution Flow

1. **Cluster Creation (01-clusters)**: This module sets up and creates EKS clusters using Terraform configurations.
2. **Autoscaler Configuration (02-autoscaler)**: This module configures the Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically manage the node count of the EKS clusters.
3. **IAM Configuration (03-iam)**: This module establishes the IAM roles and policies required for EKS and the autoscaler.
4. **ArgoCD Implementation (04-argocd)**: This module deploys ArgoCD for continuous deployment and GitOps workflow.

### Architectural Decisions

- **Modularity**: Dividing the project into distinct modules allows for better management and scalability.
- **Scalability**: The Cluster Autoscaler ensures that the cluster can scale based on workload demands.
- **Deployment Management**: ArgoCD provides a robust solution for continuous deployment and version control of Kubernetes resources.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.
- Terraform installed on the local machine.
- Necessary AWS permissions to create and manage EKS, IAM, and other related resources.

### Setup Clusters

Deploys EKS clusters in `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`, and `eu-west-1` regions, with VPC configurations and necessary subnets.

### IAM Roles and Policies

Manages IAM roles and policies required for the EKS clusters, ensuring proper permissions and security controls.

### Argo CD

Deploys Argo CD using Helm to manage continuous deployments on the EKS clusters.

### Reusable Modules

Provides reusable Terraform modules for setting up and managing various components of the Kubernetes environment.

## TODO: Security

- **Secrets Management**: Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets storage.
- **IAM Policies**: Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM policies.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt all data at rest and in transit.
- **Audit Logs**: Monitor audit logs for unauthorized activities.

## TODO: Execution

Automate the deployment and modification of the environment using CI/CD pipelines. Implement pre-deployment validations and post-deployment health checks.

## TODO: Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Use Terratest for Terraform modules.
- **Integration Tests**: Implement end-to-end tests using Kubernetes tools.
- **Continuous Testing**: Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

## TODO: General Improvements

- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation.
- **Modularization**: Ensure Terraform code is modularized.
- **Scalability**: Implement auto-scaling policies.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
